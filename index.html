          <h1>Thi Minh Thi Nguyen</h1>
          <h2>Undergraduate at University of Nebraska Omaha</h2>

          <p>Moving to the US two years ago, I made a life-changing decision to go back to school to pursue my passion for technology. I'm currently a junior at University of Nebraska at Omaha with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Math. My primary coding language is Python but I am also making good progress with Java and C. Much as I love building practical projects to automate tasks that I come across, what I am most interested in using technology is its ability to explore amazing insights from the data. </p>
          <p>In my free time, I like reading books and doing puzzles. Designing websites is also what I am interested in recentl y.</p>

            <p>I built this project in my sophomore year as a part of my class assignments. Even though it only performs basic volume calculations, it was constructed with clear coding practice and neatly arranged visuals.</p>
